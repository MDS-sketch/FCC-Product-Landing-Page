# FCC-Product-Landing-Page

This is a project I had developed and designed for freecodecamp from scratch, this site is developed purely using html and css and Bootstrap is used for navbar this was a fun project i learned about grids in depth, the site is updated to a newer version of itself i implemented a seperate page for the buy product section previously it was in the index page and also now it's fully responsive to any device in any orientation. More changes would be made as learn more aboout JS and implement them to this and other project.
